I got asked for tips on what should go in a media kit and felt it'd be best to round up any references and my final proposal into a stable place.

For the uninitiated,
a media kit is a set of resources to help (usually) journalists talk about you or your project.
They're also valuable for web designers trying to link to a specific service.
If you look at the bottom left of my website (which you might be reading this on) you'll see my social media icons.
I got most of those icons from the media kit of the service.

They can go by multiple names as well.
I'm using "media kit" here, but they have also been referred to as "press kits."
A similar resource is a "brand book", though those are usually used internally or with business partners.
As you'll see later, Meta now uses "Brand Resource Center" for the equivalent of their media kit.

As the goal is a minimum viable media kit,
we're going to look at a few examples,
then extract some common features.

### Examples

Let's start with [Meta's Brand Resource Center](https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/)

This is a very modernized version of a media kit.
If you've never experienced one this might be overwhelming to read.

Meta has split their brands out (with large buttons) so you can pick the one you care about.

They also include an import legal note on this page:

> All other forms of marketing do not require permission but must use the officially provided assets and abide by the guidelines on this site.

On your own, you should read the Meta page, but I'll talk a little about the Facebook logo page.

To follow along, click on the Facebook button on this page.

The top of the next page has a quick description of what's important to Facebook about their logo.
Further down there's a video talking about the history of the logo.
The next piece is important: That's the logo pack.
That's where the files someone is looking for live.

The next section of this page talks about the acceptable usage of the logo.
Things like proper colors and how to use it when placing it over an image.
It also includes minimum sizes and proper margins.

Below that are some examples and things not to do with the logo, followed by legal language.

This is a lot of information, but we're going to look at another example:

Here's the [Bluesky media kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16mlJPfWNnc6jj-3vGZ88SFysIY13GBp0).
You can get to it from their [press FAQ page](https://bsky.social/about/blog/press-faq).

This is just a Google Drive directory with subdirectories labeled with the resource inside.
Screens are screenshots mostly intended for app stores.
Logo is the logos, there's a set of headshots for the executives and developer team.

This is very much the opposite end of the spectrum from meta, though they provide a lot of resources.

### What Can Be Included

So a press kit can be multiple things and is often thought of as a Public Relations artifact.
Once upon a time they were brochure style, but a web page is a much better fit for this nowadays.

So what kinds of things _could_ you think about?

#### Associated Logos

I'm writing this for conference organizers, so your current conference logo is the primary one to think about.
But there's many other logos that might be considered.
Does your organizing association have a brand identity?
Consider including it.

You can also include _variants_ of your logo.
Monochrome, dark mode, light mode, consider all the uses you might want to support.

#### Usage instructions

Just like we saw in Facebook's logo, you can ask for specific layout for your logos.
Make sure to include anything important:

* Does color matter?
* Margin?
* Minimum or maximum sizes?
* Preferred fonts and weights?

#### Sound bytes

A useful tool for getting people talking about you is giving them the basics up front.
I'm including a lot of things in "sound bites" because there's a huge range of things that fit.
This is the sort of text that makes it easy to answer the "W"s: who, what, when, where, and why.

Your organization's mission statement is going to be a strong contender here, hoping to explain the why.
Similarly, you can answer the "what" with the elevator pitch of your event or project.

You can also consider a brief biography of the project and any of the people involved.

If you have any of this kind of text in your media kit, definitely duplicate the venue information and dates and times!

Remember, the goal of these resources is to make it easy to talk about you.

#### Other media

This is going to be a big grab bag and outside my own specialty.

Things like (high quality!) photos or short videos or banners and graphics.

Lots of media want some kind of media to go with written content, so providing some helps you and them.

### What should I prioritize?

If you're prioritizing on a volunteer basis:

1. Logo
2. Plain text way to refer to your project, event, or organization.
3. Logo usage notes.
4. Elevator pitch
5. Photos, especially if you already have historical ones!
6. Photo credits (Things to consider: Who took the photo; who is in the photo; who edited the photo)
7. Other written material for discussing your project, event, or organization.
